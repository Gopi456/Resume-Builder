			<h3 class="card-title">What is a CV?</h3>
			<p class="card-text">- CV is an abbreviation of the Latin words 'curriculum vitae', which mean 'life
				course'. A professional CV provides a summary and a good overview of someone's life.<br>
			</p>
			<p>- Your CV includes your education(s) and qualifications, work experience, skills, and important
				qualities. By means of your CV, your potential employer will be able to get a good picture of your
				skills, work experience, and knowledge quickly, to assess whether or not you fit the job, and therefore
				whether to offer you a job interview.

			<h3 class="card-title">What is a chronological CV, and what order should it be in?</h3>
			<p class="card-text">- The most widely used CV is known as the Chronological CV. This means that
				time-dependent components, such as education and work experience, are represented in a
				reverse-chronological structure. Your last (most recent) job should be first (top), and your first job
				should be last (bottom). This also applies to all other experiences that you mention on your CV that
				took place within a certain period, such as study programs, courses, internships, and ancillary
				activities.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p class="card-text">- The order of your CV is then as follows: personal and contact details, followed by a
				concise personal profile about yourself. Hereafter, state your training, followed by any work
				experience, languages, skills, characteristics, and interests.

				then convert it to PDF format. Search the Internet for a free CV example or CV template and see if you
				can replicate it. Or, use our where you can simply enter your data and your perfect CV will be available
